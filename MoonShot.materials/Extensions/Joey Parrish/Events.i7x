Version 1 of Events by Joey Parrish begins here.

An event is a kind of object.
An event has a number called the countdown.
An event has text called the message.
An event can be pending.  A event is usually not pending.
An event has a number called the count.  The count of an event is usually 0.

To activate (X - an event) in (Y - a number) turns:
	activate X in Y turns with message "".

To activate (X - an event) in (Y - a number) turns with message (Z - text):
	now the countdown of X is Y;
	now the message of X is Z;
	now X is pending.

To deactivate (X - an event):
	now the message of X is "";
	now X is not pending.

Triggering is an action out of world applying to one thing.
[Out of world, because the object it applies to (the counter) isn't in any physical place.]

Check triggering an event (called X):
	if the number of words in the message of X is not 0:
		say the message of X;
	deactivate X;
	increase the count of X by 1.

Every turn:
	repeat with X running through events:
		if X is pending:
			decrease the countdown of X by 1;
			if the countdown of X <= 0:
				try triggering X.

Events ends here.
