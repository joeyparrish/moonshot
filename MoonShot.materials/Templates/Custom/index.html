        We recommend you <a href="play.html">play in a browser</a>, since
        everyone has one of those, and we spent a lot of effort styling the
        game for that environment.
      </p>

        But if you are an Interactive Fiction enthusiast, you may also
        <a href="MoonShot.gblorb">download the Blorb file</a> to play in the

        Tips:
      </p>
      <ul class="tips">
        <li>If you have never played an old-school text-based adventure game or a MUD, type <tt>help</tt> to get a gentle introduction to the sorts of things you can do.
        <li>Type <tt>verbs</tt> to get a quick reference list of the actions you might need to complete the game.  Nobody likes solving the puzzle of "what exact phrase should I type".
        <li>For casual play, try typing <tt>easy mode</tt>, and the game will highlight interesting objects for you.
        <li>Everyone has a name!  Get to know the characters by typing <tt>ask about name</tt> or <tt>talk</tt> for suggestions on topics to ask them about.
        <li>Some actions involve luck.  Feel free to try something more than once if you don't succeed.
        <li>You can type <tt>undo</tt> to undo any action, including one that results in the game ending.
        <li>You can also type <tt>save</tt> to save your game and <tt>restore</tt> to load a save.
        <li>The game takes place over three days, the third of which is a sort of epilogue.
        <li>There are 9 ways to end the game, 3 of which count as winning.  You can even die before you leave the first room if you're dedicated.  :-)
        <li>There are many hidden items and fun extras, so explore and try things!
        <li>If you get lost, there is <a href="Map.svg">a map</a>.
      </ul>
